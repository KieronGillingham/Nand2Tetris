# Nand2Tetris Projects
A collection of projects completed for [Nand2Tetris Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) and [Nand2Tetris Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2). The project solutions presented here were completed sporadically over three years, and have been migrated here for organisation.

[Nand2Tetris](nand2tetris.org) is a free course created by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken that describes the design and workings of a 16-bit computer beginning with primitive logic gates and covering basic chipboards, memory, a CPU, assembly language, a stack architecture, bytecode, a high-level object-orientated language, and an operating system.
